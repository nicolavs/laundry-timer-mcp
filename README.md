# laundry-timer-mcp

This project implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to help with laundry planning.

## How it works

The server provides tools to access information about laundry preferences and real-time weather forecasts. An AI
assistant can leverage these tools to determine the best times for washing and drying clothes, especially when
line-drying is the preferred method.

## Usage with Claude Desktop for Laundry Planning

When connected to an assistant like Claude Desktop, this MCP server allows for natural language queries about laundry
planning.

For example, you could ask: "Is it a good time to do my laundry today at Sydney, NSW?"
