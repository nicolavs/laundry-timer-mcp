# laundry-timer-mcp

This project implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server designed to help with laundry planning.

## How it works

The server provides tools to access information about laundry preferences and real-time weather forecasts. An AI
assistant can leverage these tools to determine the best times for washing and drying clothes, especially when
line-drying is the preferred method.

## Usage with Claude Desktop for Laundry Planning

When connected to an assistant like Claude Desktop, this MCP server allows for natural language queries about laundry
planning.

Youâ€™ll need to add this server in the mcpServers key.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "laundry-timer": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/PARENT/FOLDER/laundry-timer-mcp",
        "run",
        "server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

After that, for example, you could ask: "Is it a good time to do my laundry today at Sydney, NSW?"

## Further Improvements

### Detailed Electricity Time-of-Use (TOU) Tariffs

To make the laundry planning even smarter, the server could be enhanced to include information about electricity
pricing. By integrating with a data source for Time-of-Use (TOU) tariffs, the assistant could identify periods of the
day when electricity is least expensive.
